# 🦀 Crabwalk

Real-time companion monitor for [Moltbot (Clawdbot)](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot) agents by [@luccasveg](https://x.com/luccasveg).

Watch your AI agents work across WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Slack in a live node graph. See thinking states, tool calls, and response chains as they happen.

## Features

- **Live activity graph** - ReactFlow visualization of agent sessions and action chains
- **Multi-platform** - Monitor agents across all messaging platforms simultaneously
- **Real-time streaming** - WebSocket connection to clawdbot gateway
- **Action tracing** - Expand nodes to inspect tool args and payloads
- **Session filtering** - Filter by platform, search by recipient

## Installation

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CLAWDBOT_API_TOKEN=your-token \
  -e CLAWDBOT_URL=ws://host.docker.internal:18789 \
  ghcr.io/luccast/crabwalk:latest
```

> Note: When running Crabwalk in Docker, the Moltbot gateway typically runs on the *host*.
> Use `CLAWDBOT_URL=ws://host.docker.internal:18789` so the container can connect.
>If you're running Moltbot with `bind: loopback` and `tailscale serve` for secure tailnet-only access, you'll need to run the crabwalk container with host networking - replace `p:3000:3000` with `--network host`
>This allows the container to reach 127.0.0.1:18789 while maintaining the security benefits of loopback-only binding.

Or with docker-compose:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luccast/crabwalk/master/docker-compose.yml
CLAWDBOT_API_TOKEN=your-token CLAWDBOT_URL=ws://host.docker.internal:18789 docker-compose up -d
```

> If gateway is `bind: loopback` only, you will need to edit the `docker-compose.yml` to add `network_mode: host`

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luccast/crabwalk.git
cd crabwalk
npm install
CLAWDBOT_API_TOKEN=your-token npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/monitor`

## Configuration

Requires clawdbot gateway running on the same machine.

### Gateway Token

Find your token in the clawdbot config file:

```bash
# Look for gateway.auth.token
cat ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json | rg "gateway\.auth\.token"
```

Or with jq:

```bash
jq '.gateway.auth.token' ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json
```

Or copy it directly:

```bash
export CLAWDBOT_API_TOKEN=$(python3 -c "import json,os; print(json.load(open(os.path.expanduser('~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json')))['gateway']['auth']['token'])")
```

## Accessing from a remote host

If you are running this on a remote server and accessing it through a non-local browser, the default allowedHosts behaviour will prevent access to the web UI.

If running in docker, you can pass the environment variable `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with a comma-separated list of hosts you wish to allow access to the crabwalk UI.

If running from source, you can either pass `ALLOWED_HOSTS` as an env var at the command line, or use a .env file.
